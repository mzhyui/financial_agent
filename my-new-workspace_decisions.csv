4. **Momentum**: The stock closed slightly lower ($139.56) than its opening ($139.60) on 2024-01-02, suggesting short-term weakness.

- **Hold (70% confidence)**: The stock is near support, and the overall trend for the past month is positive. A rebound is possible if the broader market stabilizes.
- **Sell-out (30% confidence)**: If the downtrend continues, exiting partially could lock in gains from the December rally.
- **Buy-in (0%)**: Not recommended until a clear reversal signal appears (e.g., break above $142.82 resistance).
